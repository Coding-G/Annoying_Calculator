# Annoying_Calculator
This project is a working calculator, which doesn't want to work, and you have to press the = sign like 5 times for it to work. Don't worry, this is on purpose. I've worked a lot on this
project so please, please vote for me. The calculator is just some buttons , which I coded with Javascript to behave like this. I hope you find it funny. Thank you!
