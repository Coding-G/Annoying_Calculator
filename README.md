# Annoying_Calculator
This project is a long js file mainly. It is a working calculator, which doesn't want to work, and you have to press the = sign like 5 times for it to work. Don't worry, this is on purpose. I've worked a lot on this
project so please, please vote for me. I may not be the best, but I worked a lot on this. Thank you!
